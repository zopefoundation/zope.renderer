4.0.0a1 (2013-03-01)
--------------------

- Renamed package from ``zope.app.renderer`` to ``zope.renderer``.

- Added support for Python 3.3.

- Replaced deprecated ``zope.interface.implements`` usage with equivalent
  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.


3.5.1 (2009-07-21)
------------------

- Require the new `roman` package, since docutils does not install it
  correctly.

3.5.0 (2009-01-17)
------------------

- Adapted to docutils 0.5 for ReST rendering: get rid of the
  ZopeTranslator class, because docutils changed the way it
  uses translator so previous implementation doesn't work anymore.
  Instead, use publish_parts and join needed parts in the ``render``
  method of the renderer itself.

- Removed deprecated meta.zcml stuff and zpkg stuff.

- Replaced __used_for__ with zope.component.adapts calls.

3.4.0 (2007-10-27)
------------------

- Initial release independent of the main Zope tree.
